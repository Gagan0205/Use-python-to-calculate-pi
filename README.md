# Use-python-to-calculate-pi
This is a repository with code to calculate the value of pi

First, you need to download python from python.org
Next, download the file named pi.py
Open the file using Python IDLE
It will ask you for how many decimals you need to calculate
Enter whatever number you put in the second line getcontext().prec = x (here x is whatever number of decimals you need to calculate to)
Hit enter, give it some time to calculate and tehre you get the value of pi.
I have tested this code and it works till 100000 decimal places in my computer but after that, it just doesn't respond so keep that in mind.
